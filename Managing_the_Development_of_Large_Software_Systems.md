# Managing the Development of Large Software Systems

**Dr. Winston W. Royce**

## INTRODUCTION
I am going to describe my personal views about managing large software developments. I have had various assignments during the past nine years, mostly concerned with the development of software packages for spacecraft mission planning, commanding, and post-flight analysis. In these assignments, I have experienced different degrees of success with respect to arriving at an operational state, on time, and within costs. I have become prejudiced by my experiences, and I am going to relate some of these prejudices in this presentation.

 ## COMPUTER PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT FUNCTIONS
There are two essential steps common to all computer program developments, regardless of size or complexity. The first step is an analysis, followed by a coding step, as depicted in Figure 1. This simple implementation concept is sufficient if the effort is small and if the final product is to be operated by those who built it, as is typically done with computer programs for internal use. It is also the kind of development effort for which most customers are happy to pay since both steps involve genuinely creative work that directly contributes to the usefulness of the final product.

An implementation plan to manufacture larger software systems, and keyed only to these steps, however, is doomed to failure. Many additional development steps are required. None contribute as directly to the final product as analysis and coding, and all drive up development costs. Customer personnel typically would rather not pay for them, and development personnel would rather not implement them. The prime function of management is to sell these concepts to both groups and then enforce compliance on the part of development personnel.
